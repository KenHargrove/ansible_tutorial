# ansible_tutorial

This is my Ansible/shell scripting git Repo.

Most of the content here can be created while following Learn Linux TV courses.

Any ssh keys you find are useless as the virtualbox machines are likely gone by the time you read this.

This is a collection of files I created while learning ansible and shell scripting.  None of the content is from a production environment and is only meant as a practice stash for a home lab.

Also, none of these scripts, at least for now, are of my own creation.  I have a ways to go before I can create anything useful.
