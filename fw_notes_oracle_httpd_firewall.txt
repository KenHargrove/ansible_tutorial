EDIT: Learn Linux TV says that the following command may be all we need instead of nuking the site 
from orbit like we did below.

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp


Oracle Linux would not let me see the HTTPD/Apache test page to see if the service was working. 
I had to run a bunch of command and am not sure which ones actually opened it up.
I'm pretty sure that I basically hosed the entire firewall so this is a terrible solution.

iptables -vnL

iptables -A INPUT -p TCP -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

iptables --flush

$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Commands below were not used but might be useful

sudo iptables --list --line-numbers
